##### **BMRCalculator**

- Very simple to use with easily tracked entries!

- If you decide to track progress, once you calculate your BMR for the first time, a new folder in your desktop under the name of "Progression" will pop up!

- From here, each time you want to calculate your BMR and have the option to track progress selected, a new entry of your stats will be added to your folder automatically!
